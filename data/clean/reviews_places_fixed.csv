African Burial Grounds National Monument,John Hughes,5,"I hadn't heard about this monument or the story behind it until my wife studied it at university. We both decided it had to be a stop on our trip to New York. It was very quiet there as far as people visiting, largely due to the lack of signage and it not being on a lot of tour maps. But you can feel an energy there I can't describe. I wish more people would visit this place and visit the museum to learn about this part of the history of the city and the country."
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Jesse James,5,"This free NPS site shares a sliver of the stories of the Black Africans that built this nation and city. Beautiful memorial outside and very informative visitor center just down the block, around the corner. Interpretive exhibits, information, and NPS passport stamps. Free restrooms and a small gift shop. Great stop on any trip to NYC."
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Daviad Brainard,5,"Easy to overlook this place with a powerful and fascinating story while you are in the city but take the time to stop by and learn a piece of our history. The NPS attendants were helpful and the presentation was very well done, especially as much of the story is in the history of the site being rediscovered in the 1990s and the public response. Doesn't take long at all to go through the museum and monument but well worth the time even with all the cool stuff in NYC. I have to add a comment in November 2024. Just out is a great BBC story about the history at the time that construction was happening, and the role of Peggy King Jorde in the NYC mayor's office which led to the development of this memorial. Enjoy!"
African Burial Grounds National Monument,S.Romero,5,"This place is a part of American History I hardly learned about growing up in the 1960s and 1970s! I felt honored to experience this exhibit! As one narrator said, 'this is the Ellis Island for the Africans who arrived in America!' As slaves they were abused and suffered tremendously! The movie I saw in their theater brought tears to my eyes! NYC was built on the suffering of these people! I greatly want to thank Ms. Doris for her great customer service and dedication! She was like our personal tour guide! Everyone here had a smile and were courteous; the staff and security guards! May I mention that the entrance is currently free to the public! There is a souvenir shop that uses the proceeds from the sales to support the facility! Please purchase something…just my opinion! Thank you!"
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Matt Davis,5,"Visited at the end of a great New York Underground Railroad tour. Very emotional, I had no idea New York was such a hub for the transatlantic slave trade. This history must never be forgotten, such a shame the City had to be pressured into the reinterment of the bodies and building a fitting monument to their resilience."
African Burial Grounds National Monument,WSL FLD,5,A very beautiful monument to reflect the atrocities of slavery and the corrosive effect of dehumanisation. Please visit the museum around the corner. It is well worth your 30 minutes!
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Mark Brandt,5,This serves to both make the public aware of this part of often overlooked history and as a memorial to the people and their cultures that were almost erased.
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Kimberly Bailey,5,I took my grand children.It was an absolute pleasure to have this experience. My tour guide was AMAZING !!!!Its a necessity for the culture
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Andrew Zuckerman,5,"An important site to honor the Africans that were parts of NY’s old history, giving their lives the commemoration and honor they deserved. A shorter exhibit that you can visit in an hour"
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Eugene,5,Absolutely worth a visit if you were ever around the area. Cost nothing to enter and the staff there was super friendly. It’s a part of history that’s not taught in schools and often overlooked. There’s also a short documentary playing inside a small room at the front entrance.
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Andy Smith,5,"This is a very interesting place to visit, but you also need to go to the visitor center, where the true history of the site can be found. Its quite amazing some of the things our ancestors were capable of and sites like this are a reminder of how far we have come."
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Wesley Harmer,5,"Solemn place to mark the resting place of the loved ones of those that built Manhattan. The museum, which is just around the corner is amazing and has exhibits worth exploring. The park movie is 20 mins long and tells the story of those that are buried here as well as what happened to their remains once discovered."
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Chris J,5,"A beautiful monument and a very sad and powerful piece of history. I think the city could’ve done more to acknowledge what they have done and still are doing. It’s currently being protected by scaffolding cause of the building going on next to it. Also, the government shutdown prevented us from being able to see it close up."
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Alyssa Becker,4,Got lost trying to find the memorial - but glad we persevered and made it there. We’re a little disappointed that we were not able to see the inside exhibit and learn more - as appointments were required (which we did not anticipate) - so I would look into this in advance before visiting. But an important site to see and learn from.
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Aj Mcrary,5,The African Burial Ground is a must see in Lower Manhattan! A very powerful & educational stop that should be added into the school curriculum. This is American History!
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Genesis Ortiz,5,"I gone there with my Best friend and her boyfriend to the burial ground for our history project and to be honest it’s sad. There are Men, Women and Children who are bury there and some of the corpses it’s hard to identify the body 😔"
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Abigail Vassallo,5,The indoor part was closed when we went but from outside you can see and walk a small area with signs indicating the people the space is dedicated to. I'd love to go back when it's open but it's also worth a stop if you're on foot and it's closed.
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Ari Salomon,5,Beautifully done and very touching and informative. Keep in mind that there is a visitor center indoors that has lots of displays.
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Sid C,5,"This is a powerful monument that is a national park service unit. The inside is closed (it's located inside a federal building) probably due to the pandemic, but the outside if open. There are plaques that describe how this monument came to be and provides a great learning experience. Go check it out while in NY - a good way to spend an hour learning about black history in NYC."
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Narcisse Kunda,5,What an incredible place right in Manhattan. Such rich history. So glad I went and you should too.
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Alex K,5,"A beautiful monument dedicated to enslaved Africans in New York. In a city of countless sights, almost no one knows this place exists, but it's certainly worth a short visit if you're in the area."
African Burial Grounds National Monument,G Aquino,5,"Stop by and learn about this sacred burial ground, unknown to many until the recent discovery of the site. Because the entire site is fenced off, visitors can only see and take pictures of the memorial from the street, and read the plaques with information about the history and significance of the place."
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Kimberly Campanello,5,"We went to this must-visit sacred and historical site in Manhattan and were treated to an informative museum, a excellent and powerful film, detailed insights from the ranger on duty who was involved in the excavations, and a moving visit to the site itself. An American History experience that links visitors with enslaved Black people who literally built the nation. You won't forget it."
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Camille Ray,4,"The visitor center is informative, but feels geared towards a younger audience. The monument itself is stark and austere and oddly peaceful in a busy city. I did visit on a Saturday. It is an ideal setting for meditating on the lives the monument represents."
African Burial Grounds National Monument,Susan Christie,4,"The burial ground was truly an inspirational place to be, not everyone has heard of this amazing place but this was such an educational place to be, the trip there was worth it, the staff there are helpful and full of knowledge."
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Iqbal Nathani,5,"The Islamic Cultural Center of New York is a beautiful and peaceful place for worship. The architecture is stunning, the mosque is clean and well-maintained, and the community is welcoming. Friday prayers are organized and sermons are often in English, making it accessible for everyone. A great spiritual and cultural landmark in NYC."
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Maotaz Mostafa,5,"Pros:The Islamic Cultural Center in New York was established with Kuwaiti funding from the late Emir of Kuwait. The center is well equipped and consists of two prayer floors for men and women. There is an annex at the center to provide religious consultations and services to the Islamic community in New York. The center's location is in a distinctive area in New York. Islamic rituals and prayers are performed regularly. Very grateful to have visited the center, a wonderful experience."
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Luci Cruz,5,"The people here are so nice. It’s a great environment. The khutba could have been louder, but I was able to hear it and even though I had never been there before I felt like home. I can see the woman’s spaces a little bit small but we made room for each other."
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Galuh,5,Did some conversion for someone. The Imam is very informative and accepting. they also give you certificate so you're allowed to enter mecca when needed the data. very nice and informative place. Also they will give you books and Quran for newly converts
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Muhammed Khan,5,Beautiful and spacious mosque. They have separate place in second floor for females to pray. I went there for Friday prayers. They have one at 1:30 and another at 2:30.
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,MD Fozayal Azim,5,Alhamdulillah very beautiful masjid for prayer. They open most of the time Alhamdulillah for prayer. Street car parking available.
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Mariam Fofana,1,We got our appointment canceled/ rescheduled twice before it got confirmed for 11am for a marriage ceremony. Once we got here at 10:30am imam did not get here till 1pm. I understand it was the weekend but this is why you should leave early. We all had to take public transportation some even drove so if we made it on time then why couldn’t the imam? Using transportation as an excuse is just a very poor answer. I Definitely will be telling anyone who thinks of coming here for them to choose another location for their ceremony. So unprofessional!
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Eddie Wright,5,Great place for prayer —always clean and an excellent international brother and sisterhood. I would suggest that if you are wearing new or unique shoes keep them with you. There is still theft. I reported it to the staff and they were dismissive. They need to work on that.
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Its Me,2,"I was truly surprised to hear that one of the biggest Islamic Centers in the city has closed down the Islamic weekend classes for the children in the community. These classes were a vital resource for our kids, and their absence will be deeply felt."
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Gazi Sheriff,1,Management is very rude especially the security guard.. no respect for people with disabilities
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Basir A Samid,5,The best mosque I have ever discovered in NYC! I feel like keep coming to this place since there's just so much to explore once you get around the whole building. It has a lot of space for all Muslims and a perfect partition for women where they can also hear the crisp sound of the speakers through which the Imam's voice echoes inside the mosque. Can't wait to come around once again!!
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,James Thaw,5,Salam Brothers and Sisters....I had performed 2 times for Eid Salah included in 2024. Last Year I took Screenshots to bring me here and perform Eid Salah because of Prayer times. Normally they always update on their official website. I don't know if this 2024 is not gonna work. Alhamdulillah Eid Prayer here at 4 times. Additionally please have a look their website... Thank you and Happy Eid Mubarak to all..
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Fawaz Aljehani,5,"One of the most beautiful places where you feel tranquility, comfort and peace..and meet good people..how I miss this place.."
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Omar,5,I go here for taraweeh and the imams are always good and the place is very peaceful and clean
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Sam Siam,4,Why am i this late to find this place? good place .
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Awais Rahman,5,"Biggest mosque in Manhattan, and SubhanAllah the community here is amazing. Beautiful garden and the upper level is breathtaking. I wish they had more jammats for Jummah similar to Eid. They also need to post the prayer times online and update their website."
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Sarfaraz Ahmed,4,"The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because sometimes the imam would give a long khutba , and I would miss my work. In authentic Hadith Khutba should be 7-15 min not 45 min. It’s New York City bro people have work , otherwise an amazing mosque to pray in"
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,D Duncan,4,"The biggest masjid in relation to prayer space, 116th is the only other that comes close. ICCNY also has a Masjid on 72nd street and Riverside Drive ( which is the masjid Malcolm X opened when he came back from Mecca). *There is only one kutbar given on Jummah (Friday) now which started after Ramadan was over. Remember the Hadith about the last person to arrive at the Masjid on Jummah, and surah Al Jummah, Hasten earnestly to the remembrance of Allah"" and try to get there on time or early. It will get very crowded near prayer time for the Jummah salaat. Also remember to turn your phone off or place on silent.This masjid is also open 7 days a week and has a school."""
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Aziz Ghazali,5,A beautiful Friday sermon by the Imam to remind all Muslim that there is No racism in Islam.
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Rifat Tasnim Juthi,4,The mosque closed at 5pm so I couldn't pray the Isha. That was ridiculous! Otherwise it's fine.
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Asnaan Nazrin,1,The workers/volunteers are very unprofessional and disrespectful specially when distributing water n snacks to others during this holy month...They make the community dirty by their behavior. The director doesnt seem to take any action or care very careless. My son is traumatized by the worker behavior when i took 6 year old to pray the worker told him to get out all he wanted is to grab water and a tiny piece of cake...Its a holy place these type of immature behavior shouldnt be allowed. Not only my son she also told me to refuse to give me water to break my fast. Regardless No Kids or anyone should be turn away from food in ramadan month. They collect so much funds from the city to provide the community in ramasan and this type of behavior is unnecessary. Need better leaders for this masjid...No kids should ever be treated like this and turn away. Now he has a bad experience of what is ramadan. Arabs are super racist there.
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Sabirah,3,Can’t understand why Imams scream the Khutbah instead of speaking or narrating. Screaming does not magnify truth and Soft speech does not minimize truth. I came here with peace and I couldn’t concentrate on the khutbah because I felt like I was being yelled at. I wonder if this is how The Most Honorable Rasullah delivers his Khutbah. Allahumma Rabigfirna.
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Rasheed Ali,4,"Asr today was on a lower floor than the dome. I hadn't made it upstairs yet. Obviously this Masjid is different being in new York. Parking was hard to find, however there was allot of double parking.For Asr there was a long line forming behind a guy who came late. When that group finished another group started. When that group finished another group started. It reminds me of the angels coming to worship the Kaaba of heaven."
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Masud Alam,5,Mash’Allah beautiful place. Huge space and very welcoming place. May Allah protect all of our mosques around the world.
Islamic Cultural Center Of New York,Hirat Rahman,5,Very nice place. You’ll see people from all around the world coming and praying together which is amazing.
Bethesda Fountain,Melissa Varner,5,"This area (in Central Park) was prob the highlight of my quick trip! Gorgeous fountain, live music, lots of turtles in the pond, can rent rowboats. Great vibes. Don’t forget to also go see the castle in the park. You can also do horse carriage rides or rent bikes on the park."
Bethesda Fountain,Lourdi,5,"Such a cool spot to snap some pics and just chill. Great view of the lake... peaceful, scenic, and perfect for people-watching or soaking in the view. Definitely a nice little escape in the city."
Bethesda Fountain,Nicholas Cenimo III,5,"Brought my husband (who is from San Diego) to see this iconic landmark. I really enjoy showing him places he's seen on television or in movies. Even at the tail end of winter, she doesn't disappoint. The walk through the park is still lovely and the plaza is truly iconic. We grabbed a small box lunch to share and ate there. It was lovely."
Bethesda Fountain,Dilldon Higham,5,"This is probably my favorite place in New York, and Central park. The best part is the free entertainment from all the buskers, though I do tip because they're professionals a lot of times and it's amazing to get to see them performing in a small alcove by the fountain. Rainy days can be fun for this reason as well."
Bethesda Fountain,Prosun Roy,5,"Probably the most visited and photographed place in the Central Park. Beautiful setting of the grand Fountain, sitting between the grand steps and the huge lake in the backdrop, makes it's almost surreal. You can sit here for hours, chat with your sweetheart or just admire the work of nature. It's OK to be romantic once in a while."
Bethesda Fountain,Kristi Thurmon,5,"Just as iconic as you think it is! Definitely not over-hyped. It is beautiful, even when the fountain isn't on. I loved the string duo playing Marriage of Figaro under the bridge when we were there. It was freezing and raining, but I didn't let that steal my joy!"
Bethesda Fountain,Marco Zivanovic,5,"Central Park's Bethesda Fountain is an iconic masterpiece. Its centerpiece, the Angel of the Waters sculpture by Emma Stebbins, is not only visually stunning but also deeply symbolic, representing purity and healing. The fountain is the focal point of the grand Bethesda Terrace, with its intricate carvings and the stunning Minton tile ceiling in the arcade below. It's a truly picturesque and historically rich spot, perfect for people-watching, enjoying street performers, or simply soaking in the beauty of Central Park."
Bethesda Fountain,Sean & Kendra James,5,Our carriage driver stopped here for a few minutes so we could explore and take a few pictures. Definitely worth it!
Bethesda Fountain,Michelle Yates,4,Central Park is gorgeous. So happy to have prior knowledge of Olmstead to share with the girls. Very well maintained for such a large city park.
Bethesda Fountain,James Boyd,5,"Bethesda Fountain, a breathtaking fountain in Central Park in the heart of New York, is truly awe-inspiring. I admire it, and although I visited during winter, the fountain's serenity still shone through despite the water being turned off. The overall ambiance was nothing short of magnificent and one-of-a-kind."
Bethesda Fountain,David Schroedor,5,"Pretty area of the park, and a nice place to relax for a bit while taking in the fountain and surround landscape. I know it’s been in at least a few movies, so also a cool spot for that reason"
Bethesda Fountain,Cierra Fabrigas,5,"We’ve been here in the winter and summer. Although it’s warmer, the fountain is beautiful during the summer. Flowing with plants and the running water. A must see on the way to Bethesda terrace"
Bethesda Fountain,Zunaira Ahmed,5,"It's a beautiful fountain beside a huge pond. Both the fountain and the pond have ducks in them. It's so lively and wonderful, especially during the summer (which is when these pictures were taken). Find yourself an empty seat and immerse yourself in the beautiful sights (and perhaps forget your troubles, temporarily at least)"
Bethesda Fountain,Digital Nomad,5,Must see historic fountain located in Central Park.
Bethesda Fountain,Troy Pitcher,5,"Favourite place in Central Park! Many facets to this area and had flashback from movies filmed here.Mild amount of people selling items, picture perfect from any angle. Stroll around to see it all from different perspectives."
Bethesda Fountain,Paridhi,5,"Pretty part of the central park, surrounded by pond, greenery and ancient building. We saw people getting pre-wedding shoots, there are also some food stalls, and it’s a must visit for the tourists. Crowded on the weekends but you could also find spots for a some private space and a lot of people bring their dogs to train."
Bethesda Fountain,Erik Re,5,Great spot with benches on the lake to rest and think and pray. This was an unusually warm 80 degree day in Fall. Beautiful next to Bethesda Fountain.
Bethesda Fountain,Mike Jennings,5,Lovely spot within the park. You go can first thing when it is quiet or later in the day when it is alive with families and musical performers. Both have their merits.
Bethesda Fountain,Winston Bromley,5,"An amazing area to see in Central Park. Don’t miss this one! Make sure walk all the way into the park middle. When you see the fountain and terrace, you will feel Deja Vu as it’s in so many tv shows and movies. But to be there, it’s strangely satisfying. Sit on the fountain rim for the full effect or walk over to the water where there are sometimes gondolas."
Bethesda Fountain,Saba Anwer,4,"Attended a wedding ceremony !Place has great ambiance , the terrace has beautiful arches and walls . But it’s very crowded ! The fountain is iconic tourist spot. I would advise to visit on a week day. It’s a 6-7 mins walk from the nearest gate/ entrance of the Central Park"
Bethesda Fountain,Poltergeist MusicMX,5,"One the most beautiful places in Central Park, definitely you need to go."
Bethesda Fountain,Stephen Ohara,5,"Always wanted to visit here since John Wick, amazing atmosphere!"
Bethesda Fountain,Vaihab Gupta,5,"Bethesda Fountain in Central Park is a serene oasis in the heart of New York City. The fountain's neoclassical grandeur and the surrounding angelic sculptures create a tranquil escape from the urban hustle. The reflective pool and lush greenery provide a picturesque setting, making it a perfect spot for relaxation and contemplation. Bethesda Fountain is a hidden gem that invites visitors to unwind amidst the natural beauty of Central Park."
Bethesda Fountain,Muskan Garg,5,It was the most romantic destination of my trip. All visitors were so happy and content. I could see so much of positive energy in that area.
Bethesda Fountain,Kendriya Veli,5,"The heart of Central Park! One of my favorite place to chill in the afternoon of weekends. Sitting by the fountain, Listening to local artists, Witnessing love and laughter spreading around… you’d certainly feel like you are in a movie"
Brotherhood Synagogue,SJB,5,Very well maintained facility and very friendly congregation. Services flow nicely. Fully egal Nice kiddush.
Brotherhood Synagogue,Robert Wolf,5,"My family and I have been members of Brotherhood Synagogue for 36 years-plus. Of the many synagogues I have experienced over the years, Brotherhood has by far been the warmest and most welcoming one. It has a wonderfully diverse congregation, a Rabbi who so ably adapts lessons from the Torah to everyday modern situations, a Cantor with a superb voice, all in a unique setting - a former Quaker meeting house built in 1859 that enjoys landmark status in the Gramercy Park neighborhood. My family and I have never lived in that neighborhood -- we live on the Upper East Side -- but we love coming down there for services, for programs, for celebratory events, you name it!"
Brotherhood Synagogue,Carol Ginsberg,5,"Brotherhood is like a home away from home. The Rabbi and Cantor are warm and friendly, the Exec Director is thoughtful and outgoing. Worshipping (or socializing) in a historic and beautiful building just enhances your experience. Stop by for a tour (reservations suggested due to heightened security) or come for services."
Brotherhood Synagogue,Tracie Basch,5,"What a wonderful and warm synagogue. We have been members for over 16 years and have celebrated many events - Bris, Bar Mitzvahs - and, unfortunately, death and have found the Rabbi and Staff to be wonderful and compassionate. This is an amazing community with so much to offer people of every age."
Brotherhood Synagogue,June Feigelman,5,Love this Synagogue! My brother and his wife belong here and everyone is super friendly!
Brotherhood Synagogue,Karen Sumberg,5,A wonderful and welcoming community! Our home away from home. Our kids have thrived at the nursery and Hebrew schools (annual Hebrew school play is not to be missed)!
Brotherhood Synagogue,Gary Alony NYC,5,Rabbi Dan is one of the most spiritual people you will ever meet. The synagogue is more of a community center. It used to be a Quaker meeting house. You feel the warmth when you enter. They have lectures and a fabulous hebrew school. The prayers are traditional hebrew. Men and women sit together. My wife and raised three children there.
Brotherhood Synagogue,Thompson Alchemists,4,Beautiful family oriented synagogue on the south end of the park. Amazing rabbi and wonderful congratulation. We've been members for 20 years
Brotherhood Synagogue,Deborah Blumenthal,5,"Warm, welcoming, calming environment. The Rabbi's sermons are engaging and gently thought-provoking."
Brotherhood Synagogue,David Shapiro,5,"Brotherhood is not just a synagogue to us. It's a school for our little guys. It's a strong community, it's a support network and really has become an extension of our family."
Brotherhood Synagogue,Lynn Cohen,5,"As a single woman, I’ve found the congregation to be very a very warm and welcoming community."
Brotherhood Synagogue,Gloria W,5,"A hidden gem that sits right on Gramercy Park with a warm, welcoming congregation, and incredible clergy and staff."
Brotherhood Synagogue,Brad Miles,5,Home away from home. Amazing congregation on Gramercy Park welcoming to all.
Brotherhood Synagogue,Nicki Kalisky,5,A moving sabbath and a joyful Seder. First time ever in a synagogue or celebrating passover.
Brotherhood Synagogue,Leila Abdullaleava,5,I love it
Brotherhood Synagogue,Lisa Lerderer,5,A spiritual place of light that shines through the beautiful historical windows and reflects of the walls.
Brotherhood Synagogue,Zachary Gruenberg,1,Would not let me daven after calling and explaining there are no other places open... stay away if you are new... I’d give them negative stars if I could
Brotherhood Synagogue,JJ Peon,5,Historic building that started as a Quaker meeting house. Well preserved and welcoming.
Brotherhood Synagogue,Susan Shapiro,5,A wonderful place full of community and tradition. I am very happy to be a member here and to raise my family in the community.
Brotherhood Synagogue,David Mesibov,5,It is very inclusive.& does not discriminate. I especially enjoy the Sabbath services.
Brotherhood Synagogue,David Ben Levi,5,Beautiful an historical building. Grew up knowing this place. True history told here.
Brotherhood Synagogue,Vadim Nobel,5,Wonderful Rabbi and staff. Well run.
Brotherhood Synagogue,Debora Levi,5,Beautiful place with a nice cultural program
Brotherhood Synagogue,Matthew Imberman,5,the best!
Brotherhood Synagogue,Rita S,4,in a former Friends meeting place.
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Wendy Stanley,5,"Excellent. Beautiful monument supported by helpful historic documents in the nearby Visitors Center. For those looking to understand or study the men who lost their lives on the prison ships in the American Revolution, this is a must-see. Was impressed by the size and beauty of the monument."
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,RJS,4,A gateway in the nature in the middle of the town when In Brooklyn. Not be compared with other parcs and definitely Central Park if in Manhattan. But I enjoyed a take-away coffee in the cold. Very quiet.
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Carston G,5,"A spectacular historic site in this treed verdant urban park in the densely populated heart of downtown Brooklyn. But imagine that former Parks Commissioner Mitchel Silver, and his local political allies through his race driven Parks Without Borders legacy project and fantasy, put into motion plans to eviscerate and clear cut some 80 large mature beneficial shade trees that populate the northwest corner of the park, for an open tree less vista extending all the way to the Martyrs Monument. What a contrasting behavior in the attitude toward the urban forest from Parks Commissioners that preceded Silver, like Henry Stern."
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Ben Gallagher,5,"pretty good monument, couldn't possibly give it more than 3.5 stars so I think that 4 is very generous. Have seen both better and worse monuments in my time. My experience would be greatly improved if I was able to get to the top of it."
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Alexander Astrinsky,5,"This is a beautiful monument in the middle of fort green park, it has an amazing viendo but otherwise nothing else to do."
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Peter Merchant,5,"I grew up in the Fort Greene Projects and was always fascinated by the Prison Martyrs Memorial, even from an early age However, it wasn’t until I went to college that I learned about it. What an unsung tale it is."
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,MrBlkynBoy,4,I went to fort Greene park for soul summit
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Eddie Coyle,5,"Brooklyn has an immense amount of history you walk by every day. This monument is located in an area, quite frankly, that has only become safely accessible again as Brooklyn's fortunes have improved. As to the reviewer who said waste of Time while using the American Flag and Eagle (what are you, a patriot?) as an avatar... TOOL!"
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Luke,5,"The Prison Ship Martyrs Monument is a great centerpiece for Fort Greene Park. It provides a great inspiration for runners who take on the park's steps. Make sure you learn about the fascinating history of the monument by attending a Wallabout Historical Tour put on by the Myrtle Avenue Brooklyn Partnership. In addition, you'll learn more about the surrounding Wallabout neighborhood. The only downside to the monument is that you can't go in it. The stairs that went to the top deteriorated not long after it was built. It would be so cool to go to the top to enjoy the views. Nonetheless, the monument is a beautiful symbol of the city's history."
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Kensington Whittenberg,5,Gentrification has ruined this once diverse and ethnic park. It has now been overrun with hipster yuppies dudes with fake beards and skinny jeans and their wanna be uber chic hipster female wannabees. Brooklyn used to be cool in the late 80s and early 90s but the influx of these spoiled rich white kids has made it rather vanilla and boring. Wish the old skool Brooklyn would come back or at least I wish a lot of the old skool folks would come back and take back the neighborhood. This place has gone to the dogs!
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Duy Tran,5,I love this section of the park. Great place of your working out and want to run some stairs. The view is pretty nice at the top.I want to be able to go to the top
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Colin Whitlow,5,I come here on the 4th of July every year. The view of the fireworks isn't fantastic but it gets the job done and isn't nearly as crowded as lots of other spots.
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Ted Johnson,4,Monument has new signage telling of site's history. Fort Greene Park continues to improve and is now a great destination
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Ian Moulton,4,"A moving—if strange—monument. I would prefer a more real lighthouse than a macabre stone replica, but that’s just me. Splendid view."
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Anson Chen,5,"i go to brooklyn tech, the school right next to the park. really chill place to hang out after a long day"
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Ira Christopher,5,One of the most placid areas in Brooklyn!
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Noel Maguigad,4,Beautiful little park in Brooklyn. The set of stairs is perfect for working out.
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Fernando Reyes,5,I grew up across the street from this Brooklyn landmark I miss this iconic places I gotta visit.
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Ryan Micaleff,5,Great view. Good for short runs and off leash dogs before 9am.
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Isaac Alfieri,4,Very cool monument
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Christopher Russell,5,"Mass grave of thousands of American martyred patriots monsterously murdered by the imperialist monarchists of tyrant George of England on nearby prison ships, including the vile HMS Jersey, during the reign of oppression and terror in New York during the Revolution. NEVER FORGET!"
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Cammie G,5,Great tourist attraction with a great park to have a picnic or to just chill on a nice day!
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Kevin CinnamonToast,4,"Quite a few undesirables about. Had some cheeky fun,slipped a gleeck here as a hoot. Peppery in tone."
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,MD R,5,"Helpful staff, big open areas, lots of seating. Very serene place."
Prison Ship Martyrs Monument,Carbon12,5,"Lovely spot for meditating, exercise or just snacking and enjoying your surroundings"
Mahayana Temple,Shloka Gupta,5,"It’s free. You can pick up a fortune chit and donate a dollar, light up incense sticks without cost. It was really peaceful, on the walls the story of buddha is there, in english as well. Just be respectful, very beautiful"
Mahayana Temple,Theresa St John,5,"Very peaceful place to walk around, even if you are not buddist. Beautiful buildings and property with body of water in the center. There were prayers going on so we were respectful and did not go into those structures until prayer time was over."
Mahayana Temple,Harish G Nair,5,A peaceful place inside the busy NYC at a corner of China Town. Inside it is silent and beautiful. The story of Buddhas life is written in short on the walls. Light prayer song was playing when we went in. Take a Dollar with you to get a fortune sheet. Definitely recommend a visit.
Mahayana Temple,Maggie Dynack,5,"Beautiful little temple in Chinatown , NYC. Highly recommend going if you like spiritual places like me. One of the coolest landmarks of Chinese culture."

Mahayana Temple,Manisha Patro,5,"It was so peaceful, definitely my fav place to visit."
Mahayana Temple,Connor Pollock,3,"It was nice and peaceful, interesting story about Buddhism on walls. Said required mask, but then had people inside who were not wearing them"
Mahayana Temple,Akshaya Bhagavathula,5,"The Mahayana Buddhist Temple provides a tranquil refuge from the hustle, bustle and chaotic sidewalk marketplace (fish heads, knock-off designer handbags) that is NYC's Chinatown. Located next door to one of Chinatown's other major pilgrimage sites, The Fung Wah Bus ticket office, the temple is housed in a boxy building that formerly hosted The Rosemary, a porno theater that ended its racy run in the mid '90s."
Mahayana Temple,Muninder Gulati,5,Buddhist Temple!!! Spirituality ‘n Buddha Purnima!!! Felt very peaceful and blessings of Divine!!
Mahayana Temple,Shiva Bhandari,5,Beautiful place to visit and large statues of Buddha. the best part is you get take photos.
Mahayana Temple,A Taylor,5,"Great space! It's a space for all, offering education, cultural, charity and religious/spiritual enrichment to the community..."
Mahayana Temple,David D,5,"Buddhist temple in the middle of Manhattan! Anyone no matter their religious belief should see it. I'm not Buddhist, but I enjoyed the visit here."
Mahayana Temple,mealy boo,5,Need to escape from the hustle and bustle of Canal Street step inside Mahayana Buddhist Temple. I like to just step inside sit and take some deep breath.
Mahayana Temple,Mohammed Islam,5,Historic Holy place for Buddhist Around the world besides Historic Manhattan Bridge . A Must see place at Downtown Manhattan.
Mahayana Temple,Greg Little,5,It was so peaceful and quiet coming from the noise of the busy city very friendly worth the experience
Mahayana Temple,Joe Crow,3,"It was a nice large place but it would be nice to have bathrooms. Some of the Hindu temples feel more welcoming. Unlike many of the Catholic Churches, They will not allow photography which makes many of the Catholic churches feel more like home."
Mahayana Temple,Ari S,5,It was nice an quiet. When I first walked through the door it seemed as though they sell Buddhist souvenirs. The guy working there was nice and let me look around. There is a huge statue of the Buddha all the way at the end and very cool artwork around the walls depicting and the Buddha’s life and path to Enlightenment. There were also places to make a small donation and burn incense and/or take a fortune 🔮 that is pre-wrapped. I’ll be back to try the Sunday Meditation Services meditation
Mahayana Temple,K B,1,Was yelled at within 2 minutes of arriving.
Mahayana Temple,NYC,5,"This beautiful Temple is located at the tip of the Manhattan Bridge exit to the Bowery. To me, this location is Holy, therefore, deserves the most of my respects. This is not a tour site, but everyone is welcome to share their views and beliefs. I was respectfully asked to reserve from onsite photographs. There were people with prepossessing attire, sharing a quiet prayer by the tables surrounding the Buddha and it felt very peaceful.Beautiful Jade pieces and other pieces of jewelry and souvenirs are displayed in the front entrance for sale. There's more valuable items located on the second floor, which I purchased a beads bracelet meant for healing and it's absolutely beautiful."
Mahayana Temple,Paul Epstein,4,"I love stopping inside. Many people pass this beautiful place without ever stepping in the doors. They have the best gift shop right inside the lobby. Extremely reasonable prices. Look inside, make an offering."
Mahayana Temple,Kat Butler,5,"Very few tourists, bring an offering from the many fruits and flowers you can find from the vendors on Canal st. If you are a tourist please dress appropriately and observe noble silence. There is a gift shop upstairs that is easy to miss, it has chanting CDs and many crafts with an English speaker working there. I come here at least once a month, very authentic. Beautiful place. To those saying they have been to “Great Temples” and don’t like this one, I have been to Angkor and many others, but they are NOT IN NYC!! This is a Temple not a tourist site, and as a tourist you are lucky to be able to see such a nice Temple in the heart of the city, especially if you have never been to Asia."
Mahayana Temple,Doug White,3,"Best temple to see illustrations of the life of the Buddha Sakyamuni. The only temple in NYC with a set of 32 pictures. Spending a half hour here to see these beautiful Thai style pictures & read the captions (in Chinese & English) will make a visit here worthwhile. The 9-dragon screen high on the back wall is unique to NYC also. And the huge bronze bell is, of course, impressive. Otherwise, this temple is not special, just a spacious tourist trap. Because a donation box is placed in the middle of the narrow hallway to the main room, most visitors feel pressure to donate. But there is no admission fee & no obligation to donate. Feel free to walk right in & enjoy the peaceful ambiance. (FYI, the building is a former movie theater.)"
Mahayana Temple,Nas,4,It was a nice place to visit.
Brooklyn Bridge,Kaptain Guzzy,4,"Pretty...good walk across the bridge with lovely views over the Brooklyn skyline. Beautiful around sunset! Hawkers on the bridge selling touristy stuff like caps, fridge magnets, freshly-cut fruit bowls, key chains, tote bags etc. Walk across the bridge to Brooklyn and walk around - there's lots of eating places, including seafood and particularly pizzerias!!"
Brooklyn Bridge,Nikhil KK,3,It's always great to shoot photos from the Brooklyn Bridge. But this time it was kind of disturbing as there were no control on the street vendors on the bridge. Authorities should control the number of vendors so that the beauty of the bridge is maintained and people have more space to walk and enjoy this iconic bridge.
Brooklyn Bridge,Legends I,5,An iconic bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn.You can even see the Statue of Liberty in the distance. It is worth walking to downtown Brooklyn and taking a stroll along the banks of the Hudson River if approaching the bridge from Manhattan. Nice part of town and definitely worth a visit.
Brooklyn Bridge,Jiban Gurung,5,"As a travel enthusiast, and coming from California, I walked the bridge from one end to another on a cloudy day and it was a good walk with a perfect view… I recommend getting your water and/or snacks for the trip. There’s manhattan bridge near by if you would like to walk more."
Brooklyn Bridge,Ann S,5,"Beautiful early morning walk. Arrived at about 0530 in the morning. Not crowded which allowed for some fantastic photos. I definitely recommend going! Such a great way to start your city exploration, walk the bridge then keep walking and check out the city when it’s not as crowded!"
Brooklyn Bridge,Keepsake Memories,5,"Walking the Brooklyn Bridge was a highlight of our recent trip to NYC!! It was fun stepping unto such a historic bridge and seeing the cityscape and cars driving underneath. We walked over the bridge and then walked further into Brooklyn. It wasn't a short walk, but it was worth it. Pack drinks to stay hydrated and have your camera or phone ready for selfies and group pics."
Brooklyn Bridge,Loves Travel,5,"During my trip to the USA, I had the chance to visit the iconic Brooklyn Bridge in New York. The views of the city from the bridge are absolutely stunning, and its architectural design is truly remarkable. It’s one of NYC’s most popular tourist attractions — a must-visit spot that definitely deserves a place in your travel diary"
Brooklyn Bridge,Paul Vivas,5,"Iconic, Legendary & scenic bridge of New YorkThis is possibly the most famous bridge in New York and also famous worldwide. We enjoy passing under it with the ferry (NYC) and also crossing it by foot.Although this took longer that we expected, here count more time that quoted on all the different sites, as you will be stopping to take pictures, etc plus the bridge does get crowded specially in summer period."
Brooklyn Bridge,Ashish K,5,"Walking across the Brooklyn Bridge is like stepping into a living postcard. The views of Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty, and the East River are absolutely breathtaking—especially around sunset. There’s something magical about feeling the breeze, hearing the hum of the city, and watching the skyline unfold in front of you. The blend of history and beauty makes this one of New York’s most unforgettable experiences. Whether you’re walking, biking, or just stopping to take photos, the bridge has a special charm that makes you fall in love with the city all over again."
Brooklyn Bridge,Meghana Jain,5,"Walking across the Brooklyn Bridge was such a memorable experience! The views of the Manhattan skyline and the Statue of Liberty are incredible, especially around sunset. It’s a perfect mix of history, architecture, and city vibes. The walk is easy and full of photo ops — definitely a must-do when you’re in NYC!"
Brooklyn Bridge,Muhammed Ballan,5,We liked the walk on Brooklyn Bridge! We took some professional pictures by photographer offering this service there! You can also see the Statue of Liberty from there ❤️
Brooklyn Bridge,Simon Thomas,5,Iconic visit. We signed up for a 3hr cycle tour of NYC sites using our City Passes. Absolutely the best way to see the city. The guide took us right to the rivers edge to photograph the bridge from some excellent viewpoints. Definitely a must-try. As long as it's not raining!
Brooklyn Bridge,Tibor,5,"The Brooklyn Bridge is one of New York’s most iconic landmarks, and walking across it toward Manhattan is an unforgettable experience. The view is stunning—skyscrapers rising in the distance, the river below, and the steel cables of the bridge framing it all perfectly. On the Brooklyn side, the Brooklyn Bridge Park offers a fantastic vantage point to take in the whole scene. From here, the bridge stretches out with the Manhattan skyline behind it—an absolutely classic New York moment. Whether you walk it or just admire it from the park, it’s a must-see."
Brooklyn Bridge,S B,5,"Quite a walk across it (1.1 miles) but excellent views and the crowds kept moving, despite it being busy. Rule of walking on specific sides depending on direction worked well, with most people adhering to it. Great place to see and experience whilst in NYC."
Brooklyn Bridge,Wojtek C,4,"A legendary place in New York. You can admire the giant skyscrapers of Manhattan from it. In addition, there are boards on it from which you can learn something about the history of this place. The only downside is the hordes of tourists moving over this bridge every day"
Brooklyn Bridge,Aaron Goode,5,"Beautiful, long walk with stunning views. Be aware there will be masses of people at points with very slow moving crowds. Regardless it was stunning"
Brooklyn Bridge,Olayide Olumeko,5,"The history behind this bridge evokes deep admiration for the brave minds of the 18th century. It reflects the incredible creativity of humanity—the people behind it, the purpose it served, and the innovative engineering solution it represented. I spent two hours around this bridge, and it will remain a lasting memory for me."
Brooklyn Bridge,SonnyInPhilly215,4,It's a nice long walk on the bridge. There's some vendors on the bridge for drinks and little souvenirs. It's a 👍 place for photos if the skylines. You can see the statue if Liberty but it is small.
Brooklyn Bridge,Dennis John,5,"Walking across it offers breathtaking views of the skyline, the Statue of Liberty, and the East River. The blend of historic architecture and modern city life makes for an unforgettable experience. Whether you're a tourist or a local, it's the perfect spot for a scenic stroll, especially at sunrise or sunset. Just be prepared for some crowds, but the atmosphere and views are well worth it!"
Brooklyn Bridge,Ana Cardoso,5,"Walking across the Brooklyn Bridge is one of those classic New York experiences that never gets old. The views of the skyline and the river are stunning. It can get crowded, but it’s worth it."
Brooklyn Bridge,Rebecca Franklin,4,"We didn't walk all the way across it because we were short on time, but from what we did see....we loved it. It was super crowded though so keep that in mind. I heard the best time to see it is during the day. We were there late at night."
Brooklyn Bridge,Jezzer Pezzer,5,A beautiful view of Manhattan from Brooklyn. A stunning bridge. You can see the Statue of Liberty in the distance. Grab an ice cream and enjoy the view!
Brooklyn Bridge,Melanie Mengus,5,Beautiful bridge that you have to see during your stay in NY! It’s an iconic place. I suggest walking on the bridge to get beautiful views over the city. It’s a nice spot to have a nice photo especially in the morning as it’s quite calm. If you want to see the bridge from afar I suggest visiting the Peebles Beach. It’s the perfect spot!
Brooklyn Bridge,Elizabeth Stubbs,5,"I actually went at night; the views were still beautiful and picturesque. There were a couple of vendors set up with Panorama photo equipment machine things and loud cliche music (imagine Jay Z & Alicia Keys singing about NY on repeat lol) - I could have done without those. But the crowds were light, and the experience was mostly Serene / peaceful"
Brooklyn Bridge,F C,5,"Many instagram moments at this Iconic Brooklyn Bridge. The area by the water is so relaxing. Perfect location to watch sunset! Took about 25 minutes to walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan. Beautiful view of the river, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island."
Saint Malachys,Hilarion Martinez,5,"Stumbled into it after seeing Chicago on Broadway & participated in Saturday 5 pm mass which was sung by a young g man w a spectacular voice. The church interior is breathtakingly beautiful. If you are going to any theater on Broadway, do not miss a visit to this small jewel box. I loved it. It was an unexpected surprise; the best kind. I took outside pics as I was attending the mass & could not take pics."
Saint Malachys,Ramon Portilla,5,This is a special small yet full of solitude to pray and attend mass at 8am. It was moving to see many devoted Catholics early.
Saint Malachys,Ivette Davila Richards,5,After working the night shift I was so happy to find a church I could go to and say my prayers. The Service was beautiful. The message was relevant and on point. The choir sang superb! I lit a big candle in honor of some important people in my life who passed last year. Very happy no tickets were required to go in like other churches on Christmas Eve!
Saint Malachys,Glen McCall,5,I love stopping here. Always a nice quiet place in a chaotic part of the city. I love how their statues and artwork deal with the patron saints of the performing arts.12/27/19: Visited a second time during the Christmas season. Absolutely beautiful!
Saint Malachys,Elizabeth,5,Gorgeous little church; looks very out of place in the city lol
Saint Malachys,Safet Cucaj,5,Great Church. It has holiness. As soon as you walk in I was able to easily feel and pray in the spirit. Not all churches have that smooth immediate launching of the spirit. This is my opinion. Praise Jesus.
Saint Malachys,Nicholas Petrillo,5,"Went to daily Mass here and the priest sang several parts of the Mass. Would love to be there with the choir, as I hear incredible things. Small church, but large in faith."
Saint Malachys,Angela Funnell,5,The most beautiful church I have seen in a long time. The sounds of music sound like heaven.
Saint Malachys,Teresa Trich,5,What a beautiful experience. The priest was so welcoming and the service was uplifting.
Saint Malachys,John Baldino,5,"Beautiful Mass, relatable homily, welcoming atmosphere, convenient location."
Saint Malachys,Claudio Silva,5,"I love this place. It is now open again with great show, piano and violin 🎻 are my favorites."
Saint Malachys,Jason Marsh,5,We went to Sunday mass while in town. Very nice!
Saint Malachys,Marc D,5,"Small church in the middle of skyscrapers filled with statues and pictures of Catholic Saints, Mother Mary and Jesus. Only attended one Mass but had a chance to look around"
Saint Malachys,Gordan Nash,5,"A gorgeous place with good acoustics, perfect for a concert."
Saint Malachys,Sandra Ashton,5,I love this little chapel. It was very peaceful. Although it was small it had the feel of a big church because of the architecture. It smelled just like a Catholic Church. My husband and I just stopped in for a few minutes while walking around the area. I would recommend stopping in if you are in the area. I thought it was a funny coincidence that is directly across from The Book of Mormon play
Saint Malachys,JR,5,Beautiful Church.Tabernacle is all gold. Shrine to Jesus on the left. Smaller than other Catholic churches like St. Patrick's or St. Vincent Ferrer. Enjoyed an awe inspiring Baroque concert Thursday.
Saint Malachys,Iliana Cordero,5,"Beautiful church. Everyone involved in making this church what it is, is top notch. My daughter did her First Holy Communion here and on her way to doing her Confirmation."
Saint Malachys,Glenn Cody,4,"The church is beautiful. I enjoyed the mass and the choir because everything was easy to follow along with. My only complaint is with the seating. In certain sections, you can't see the alter because of the pillars in the cathedral so be careful when picking a seat."
Saint Malachys,Susan Maasberg,2,Went to st. Malachi and could not get in so our visit was wasted.
Saint Malachys,Katie Hallock,5,"A fine place for a visitor to pick up mass. Of course the quality of music/pianist/singers was way above what we find at other random churches on our travels. Thank goodness. No one talked to us, we were left in peace - just the way we like it! But Father did stand at the door as we left - so you can thank him and shake his hand if you like."
Saint Malachys,Jim Izer,5,Beautiful Chapel. 9am Mass on Sunday was lovely.
Saint Malachys,Joseph Gumney,5,"Great place to take a short respite from the bustle. Still plenty of noise from the street outside. Really cool shrines for various Saints. including St. Jude, Cecilia, and others. Donate some money, light a candle, and PRAY! And if here during a Mass, definitely attend! Really cool!"
Saint Malachys,Kelly McShain,5,"Always a haven! Intimate, beautiful, friendly, a spiritual oasis in Manhattan. Fantastic High Mass music. Always welcoming to both tourists and returning Catholics alike.My Actor hubby and I got married in this jewel box of a Church- a truly special place!"
Saint Malachys,Arthur Carvajal,5,"This little church just off Broadway is charming, a beautiful and quiet repose from the swirl of excitement and humanity nearby in Times Square. The prayers and sermons sometimes refer to the theater and the arts, as one would expect from this actors' church."" I like coming to Mass here when I'm staying at a hotel near Times Square because it is a short walk away."""
Saint Malachys,Miguel Perez,5,"I love this beautiful church in the heart of Manhattan's theater district. I try to celebrate mass every day at 8am, before I start my work day. St. Malachy has truly been a blessing in my life."
East End Temple,Bell Elor,5,"The Rabbi of East End Temple is committed to sharing his beautiful space with Middle Collegiate Church, which has no sanctuary due to the massive fire of Dec.5, 2020.The Congregation has been so welcoming, and both are committed to Social Justice and hunger ministries. The Temple is an embracing non- hierarchical setting, fully accessible, with updated technology and plenty of light."
East End Temple,Lisa Bornfree,5,"Very nice place to teach kids about their Jewish religion. They also have a wonderful sleep away camp. The Rabbi at this temple is very friendly, he interacts with the students in a very pleasant way. Not forgetting the staff in the office who are also very polite, kind and friendly"
East End Temple,Jenn Rozany,5,"I've been a member here for over 10 years, and it's an amazing organization. Progressive, inclusive, and familiar are three words I would use to describe it. Our Rabbi and Cantor are at the top of their game, and our board cares so much for the community. Wouldn't trade it for the world."
East End Temple,Nitzan Mager,5,"This is a warm, open, and friendly community. It's a great place for families-- they have a wonderful Hebrew School that kids really enjoy and thrive in-- with lots of hands on activities. If you're looking for a progressive downtown Jewish community, this is the place."
East End Temple,Elissa Macklin,5,"I've been a member for over 25 years. This is the warmest, most welcoming congregation I've belonged to."
East End Temple,Bill M,5,I am not Jewish but was at the temple for a wedding service. It is a beautiful temple and the Cantor there was beyond excellent.
East End Temple,Aiyana Stern,progressive synagogue and kind heart felt rabbi,
East End Temple,Nicole Rodriguez,1,People are so rude at this temple!
East End Temple,Dan Bleicher,5,Rabbi Josh is the best. A warm fellow with a welcoming smile and kind words. The cantor was superb. A woman with a guitar with a nice voice who wasn't overbearing. She knew the liturgy well but didn't crowd the stage.We attended a service in the Park- across the street from the synagogue.Very nice with wonderful people in attendance.
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Goks Nair,5,"Beautiful cathedral right on the 5th Avenue. Its recommended to visit without caps or backpacks. The church store is also pretty stocked. There is a bigger one behind the church. However, the one at the church is just as good.The security is tight and the atmosphere is just like any ither religious place- silent.Very peaceful to just sit and reflect whichever faith you may come from."
Saint Patricks Cathedral,The Explorer,5,I stopped in today to say a prayer for the families of the innocent people recently murdered at 345 PARK. We have been her many times over the years and every time it still impresses me. So beautiful both in and out. A very popular spot for tourists to visit as well.
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Mel Johnson,5,What a breathtaking church in the middle of the city! The architecture and rich history made this such an emotional experience to visit. So much beauty and artistry to take in.
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Jennifer Hostmann,5,"Attended the 7AM Mass and it was a beautiful, peaceful experience. The cathedral is absolutely stunning—both inside and out—with a calm, reverent atmosphere that’s perfect for reflection. Early Mass was quiet and not crowded, which made it even more special. A must-visit in NYC, whether for worship or to take in the breathtaking architecture."
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Johnny Mccahill,5,"The cathedral is American historical icon. It's well worth it time to take a tour. But if you don't, you can still enjoy a magnificent interior and may be fine. Peace of mind."
Saint Patricks Cathedral,John Dcosta,5,An unbelievably amazing Cathedral! I'd never imagined such an architectural marvel in the middle of the skyscraper jungle that is New York! Mind-effing-blowing!! A must see and now I know why my friend literally dragged me over there. We spent almost an hour inside and would love to spend more. Visiting this again next time.
Saint Patricks Cathedral,K R,5,"LOVED IT !!! can’t wait to Come back here in the future and enjoy a long weekend! Just went for a few hours but I loved it. It’s very cold !! So wear gloves and extra layers ! Beyond beautiful! As a truck driver I visit a different cathedral every week but this one had my jaw on the floor. How beautiful, how clean. The Sunday mass was beyond beautiful! I hope to someday bring my parents to this church. The liturgy was so beautiful. So many cute gifts to buy as well! The work on how beautiful this church is is beyond amazing. So many details, so much beauty to take in!"
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Alfredo Alvarez,5,"Oh, this church is amazingly beautiful. The outside, the inside, everything is gorgeous. I think the designated areas are a beautiful touch. Craftsmanship and design are applause worthy for those involved. The statues the artwork the windows everything is beautiful. Didn't get to do mass but had the pleasure of walking around and time to look at everything. The virgen de Guadalupe area was pretty. Def the prettiest church I been to."
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Celtic Marine,5,"Was in NYC for the weekend to celebrate my birthday. Dropped in to attend 8:00 AM Sunday Mass. This wasn't my first time visiting St. Patrick's or attending Mass there. For me, it is always a very soul satisfying experience to return. I appreciated that the tourists were respectful of the Mass service and the church overall. Sadly, that isn't always the case. Perhaps it being so early & on a Sunday morning made a difference. If you're a person of faith, and can make the time, try to fit in a Mass. If you're not a person of faith, please, feel welcome to visit. You don't have to be Catholic to appreciate the beauty, art, & architecture of the cathedral. I always find walking around St. Patrick's Cathedral spiritually refreshing. I would hope you could have a similar experience. Pax vobiscum..."
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Erica Gomora,5,"Love the cathedral, this time I had the chance the mass of Friday at noon and decided to stay to hear it.Not a lot of visitors as last time I visited which made it better and was really easy and fast to go in.I was able to lit up some candles and say my prayers which was the best part of the visit!"
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Stanly Wilson,5,The catholic cathedral of New York. A good and give church. It has many stained glass windows. It has a crypt with the bodies of Bishops. It has a perpetual adoration chapel and small chapels dedicated to saints.
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Manikandan,5,"St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan is a stunning Neo-Gothic Roman Catholic church located on Fifth Avenue. Completed in 1878, it features soaring spires, intricate stained glass, and a serene interior. As a spiritual and architectural landmark, it draws millions of visitors and worshippers each year, symbolizing faith amid urban grandeur."
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Micale,5,"Visited for the second time and is even more beautiful during day time. Inside is cool and refreshing. The art on the windows is magnificent. There's a private room on the back of the altar where you can pray to the virgen Mary, mother of God. There's also a section to pray to the Sacred Heart Of Jesus. You will find many sections were you can light on candles with a donation of 3.00 cash or use the big QR code on display. To my surprise I got a thank you email for my donation. The arquitecture is Amazing. Make sure you look up!! There also 2 souvenir shops pass the guards, to your right, there is a little one with items ranging grom 2.00 to 100.00. Silver rosaries and bracelets are really pretty and very affordable. Also have cute little prayer traveling books and other small items . I got a guardian angel coin for my grandson that's beautiful- picture attached. Good place to get some of your Christmas gifts shopping including Christmas tree decor. You can always visit just to spend some reflecting time because even though is full of visitors is pretty much quiet. Note: There's a hidden bathrooms but I wont post location because people will go there just for that and this has to be keep clean for parishioners and like. This Catedral is a place not to miss."
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Rachael Wright,5,"Even if you aren’t Catholic I suggest going to mass to see this place being used in the format for which it was built. I’ve been to major futbol stadiums in Europe and you’re always stunned by the size, but the fullest experience comes from seeing it full of people, unified on a single thing. In this case, it’s the Eucharist, but don’t worry - you don’t have to take communion, and if you’re not Catholic you shouldn’t - so just stay in your pew and enjoy the music."
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Will Corpuz,5,Architecturally beautiful. Just in awe. Very peaceful when you are inside. Just so happened the doors opened when walking by and thought to stop in. Please take off hats when inside.
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Manasa,5,Beautiful gothic architecture. Serene and tranquil atmosphere inside. It was indeed a holy place to sit and meditate.
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Gabriel Santos,5,"Such an amazing experience! It is beautiful inside and out. You can really see the history and the details of the Cathedral just by walking around. It was an amazing sermon, the Priest was very wellspoken and really delivered on the subject of the diversity of people in the Cathedral"
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Abigail Sahagun,5,"Such a beautiful space, intricately designed to be set apart as a place to worship God. Everything designed to point to Him and remind each person of His sacrifice, His gifts, and the deeds of some of the giants in the faith that have come before us. Awe inspiring"
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Lanash Lath,5,Very beautiful church located close to Times square. When we visited they had a service going on for the pope that just passed away. It was beautiful to see the inside of the church and all the monuments and decor.
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Joyce James,5,A beautiful cathedral and so iconic.

Saint Patricks Cathedral,Matt Baldwin,5,"St. Patrick’s Cathedral is a breathtaking sanctuary in the heart of a city that never stops moving. Amid the steel and glass of Midtown, its soaring spires and intricate stonework stand as a timeless tribute to faith, tradition, and beauty. Step inside and you’re instantly wrapped in quiet reverence—the kind that hushes even the busiest mind. In a city racing toward the future, St. Patrick’s holds its ground with grace, a sacred pause in the pulse of progress."
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Molly Howarth,5,"It was interesting to look at the graves of all these important historical figures, and there was no line to see them either. Beautiful stained glass window too. Definitely something worth seeing."
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Cathy K,5,Magnificent!! They must see 103 stained glass windows! You only need tickets if you want to take the tour otherwise it's a self tour.
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Stefanie Ernst,5,"A gorgeous home for the Lord. The architecture is glorious. Very fit for the house of our God! The Priests are amazing, the homilies are always straight to the point. I feel home when I go to St. Patrick’s."
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Sherry Cabrera,5,I’ve always wanted to go inside this beautiful cathedral as we stay next door at the Lotte hotel. For Valentine’s weekend this year my boyfriend took me there on a private tour and proposed. This history and details the tour guide gave us were wonderful.
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Laura Beskid,5,"Beautiful church! When we visited, there was a wedding ceremony happening, and I was excited to see how it's performed."

Saint Patricks Cathedral,Pierdante Romei,5,"St. Patrick's Cathedral is a breathtaking sanctuary in the midst of Manhattan's bustling modernity. Its neo-Gothic architecture, with soaring spires and intricate stained-glass windows, stands in stunning contrast to the sleek skyscrapers surrounding it. Stepping inside, you are enveloped by a profound sense of peace and reverence, a stark departure from the city's constant motion. The craftsmanship is extraordinary, and the quiet beauty of the cathedral invites reflection and awe. A must-visit for those seeking a moment of tranquility and a glimpse into New York's rich spiritual and architectural history."
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Jerome Singh,5,"If you prefer a solemn, traditional Catholic Mass, in English or Spanish, done in under 1 hr, then this is a good pit stop as a visitor. Reach at least 10 minutes before the Mass starts to take in the atmosphere and, of course, pray."

Saint Patricks Cathedral,Paul Edwards,5,What a fabulous cathedral this is. Right in the middle of everything and we visited on a Sunday so there was a service in progress when we were there. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit although the audio guide ipad stopped working soon after we had started it.
Saint Patricks Cathedral,Joanna Potter,5,"This is a bucket list. I was amazed and impressed at not only the architectural in the building but everything about the building. Inside, the ceilings are almost 3 feet high, and there are stained glass windows on each level.The organ is stunning the design.of the statues is absolutely amazing. Pictures do not do it, Justice. I was able to get in on the last part of a mass, and I was happy to light candles for my family. I just missed the gift shop, which had so much stuff inside. I was disappointed that they closed before. I could get into it, but I was so busy walking around inside and outside taking photos"
